# Learning Never Stops

That's why I created this repository.

This is my personal **software engineering training workspace**, where I practice, refine, and organise problems across data structures, algorithms, and REST API exercises. Each folder represents a focused area of learning, and each module contains multiple implementations, variations, and experiments. My goal is not only to solve problems but to understand the patterns behind them and build a consistent foundation I can rely on in interviews and real engineering work.

## 📚  Training Profiles

I will continue expanding and improving these exercises in conjunction with my HackerRank and LeetCode exercises:

- **HackerRank**: [TechAngelX](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/TechAngelX)
- **LeetCode**: [TechAngelX](https://leetcode.com/u/TechAngelX/)

## 📚 What This Repository Contains

This repository documents my progress as I work to become a stronger software engineer. Over time, the collection will grow to include:

- Core data structures (arrays, maps, sets, stacks, queues)
- Common algorithm patterns (sliding window, binary search, two pointers)
- Sorting and searching exercises
- Matrix and 2D-array problems
- Recursion practice
- REST API integration problems (Java HTTP requests)
- Clean code rewrites and optimised solutions

## 💡 Philosophy

Every solution is written manually, tested, and explained with code comments where needed, before uploading to Github. The intention is long-term muscle-memory and understanding, not just passing a test.

##  Progress

This workspace is continuously evolving. Check back regularly for new problems, patterns, and improvements.
